# Groundskeeper

A tool designed to parse through all the plan files in Biome (or Habitat), and discover the latest version available for that plan.

# Requirements

This was designed and developed on a MacOS machine. As such, certain tools and options might be Mac (or BSD) only.

The goal is to have this implemented as standard Shell, designed for linux systems.

Currently requires the following commands:

* jq
* curl
* uniq
* sort
* grep
* awk
* sed
* find
* tail
* head
